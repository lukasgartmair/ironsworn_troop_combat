I imagine a troop-based combat system for Ironsworn, designed to handle larger-scale battles in the style of Age of Empires or Total War.
It introduces mechanics for organizing armies with different unit types like Skirmishers, Warriors, Cavalry and Archers. The system factors in army size, unit advantages, and other modifiers like terrain and special abilities. The goal is to provide a manageable way to handle battles involving multiple units without complicating the core gameplay. Custom modifiers can make the system flexible for your own customization.

The scripts are mainly for simulation and balancing reasons.
Feel free to contribute or write me any suggestions you imagine.
